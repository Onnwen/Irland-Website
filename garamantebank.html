        <h2>Our beautiful bank</h2>
        <p>
            At Garamante Bank we believe in beautiful things. We are based in the stratospheric center of Dublin, an
            ingenious community famous for
            its creative spirit. We brought these emotions to the banking sector. Our innovative AI-driven strategies
            are
            capable of lowering your company's tax rates up to 0.5%. An industry record.
            <br>
            <br>
            Our historical partnership with Guinness has led to the relocation of our headquarters in the Guinness
            Storehouse in Dublin. A place that attracts good and money-loving minds. We love money and it is not a shame
            for
            us to say it.

                        In 2014, we were able to reduce the taxes paid by Apple to 0.005%, about 12,000 times less than
                        what they would normally have paid with the taxes of the respective countries in which they

                        and safe: we collaborate closely with the Irish government to obtain reduced rates
                        and our artificial intelligence technologies allow us to significantly reduce unnecessary

                lobbyists work hard at the parliamentarians of the European and Irish parliaments to prevent an unfair

                that have seen power shift from been to companies. The impact of our work is starting to be visible in

            Facebook’s main Irish subsidiary paid an additional €35 million to settle outstanding tax matters last year
            as the amount of money it set aside to cover potential fines from regulatory investigations increased to
            more than €1 billion.
            <br>
            <br>
            Revenues jumped by €6.3 billion to €40.6 billion at Facebook Ireland in 2020 as pre-tax profits rose to €890
            million from €482 million a year earlier.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            The company’s corporate tax liability rose to €266.3 million from €173.2 million, largely as the result of
            it agreeing a resolution to tax matters and paying an additional €35 million to the Revenue Commissioners.
            This comes after the company’s tax liability in 2019 increased almost threefold from €63.2 million as it
            paid €53 million in additional taxes to the Irish exchequer.

            In 2014, the corporate giant paid just $50 in tax for every million it made selling iPhones and iPads to
            most of the world outside America.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            That's a tax rate of just 0.005%. Yes, you read that correctly.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            So how was that allowed to happen?

            Apple has funneled most of its profits from Europe, the Middle East, Africa and India through Ireland for
            decades. Nothing unusual in that. Others do it too.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            But under deals the company struck with the Irish government as far back as 1991, it was allowed to split
            these profits between its Ireland branch and an Apple head office that existed only on paper.

            Tech giant Google Ireland agreed a €218 million tax settlement with Revenue this year, according to
            documents just filed. This formed part of its total corporate tax bill of €622 million, which is detailed in
            its 2020 financial accounts.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            Google Ireland also paid €127.2 million in interest to Revenue, the company documents show, bringing the
            full settlement to €345.2 million.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            During 2021, Google paid interim dividends of €3 billion to its immediate parent. The company is ultimately
            owned by Alphabet.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            The accounts also show tech giant’s wage bill exceeded €500 million for the first time in 2020, with
            employees paid more than €120,000 on average.
            Google Ireland Ltd recorded turnover of €48.4 billion in 2020, up €2.7 billion on the €45.7 billion of a
            year earlier.
