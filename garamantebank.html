        <h2>Our beautiful bank</h2>
        <p>
            At Garamante Bank we believe in beautiful things. We are based in the stratospheric center of Dublin, an
            ingenious community famous for
            its creative spirit. We brought these emotions to the banking sector. Our innovative AI-driven strategies
            are
            capable of lowering your company's tax rates up to 0.5%. An industry record.
            <br>
            <br>
            Our historical partnership with Guinness has led to the relocation of our headquarters in the Guinness
            Storehouse in Dublin. A place that attracts good and money-loving minds. We love money and it is not a shame
            for
            us to say it.

            All this in the greatest confidentiality. Over the past few decades, we shifted the global community focus
            to poor's tax havens: Panama, the Cayman Islands and Bermuda. Our beautiful
            Ireland
            is not yet part of the Financial Secrecy Index.

            In Garamante Bank, the phone is not an alarm clock. We work hard every day to make our customers happy. We
            have a satisfaction rate of almost 100% and we are recommended all over the world.

                    <h3>REDUCED TAXATION</h3>
                    <p style="padding: 15px;">
                        In 2014, we were able to reduce the taxes paid by Apple to 0.005%, about 12,000 times less than
                        what they would normally have paid with the taxes of the respective countries in which they
                        work.
                        <br>
                        We are proud of the goals we have achieved and are aiming higher and higher. We could break our
                        next record with you: join us.

                    <h3>SCANDAL RISK</h3>
                    <p style="padding: 15px;">
                        In 2016 Panama Papers broke out and we understand the fears of our future clients. Here at
                        Garamante Bank we are competent, unlike our friends at Mossack Fonseca. Our strategies are legal
                        and safe: we collaborate closely with the Irish government to obtain reduced rates
                        and our artificial intelligence technologies allow us to significantly reduce unnecessary
                        spending.
